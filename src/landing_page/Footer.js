          Attention investors: 1) Stock brokers can accept securities as margins
          from clients only by way of pledge in the depository system w.e.f
          September 01, 2020. 2) Update your e-mail and phone number with your
          stock broker / depository participant and receive OTP directly from
          depository on your e-mail and/or mobile number to create pledge. 3)
          Check your securities / MF / bonds in the consolidated account
          statement issued by NSDL/CDSL every month. "Prevent unauthorised
          transactions in your account. Update your mobile numbers/email IDs
          with your stock brokers. Receive information of your transactions
          directly from Exchange on your mobile/email at the end of the day.
          Issued in the interest of investors. KYC is one time exercise while
          dealing in securities markets - once KYC is done through a SEBI
          registered intermediary (broker, DP, Mutual Fund etc.), you need not
          undergo the same process again when you approach another
          intermediary." Dear Investor, if you are subscribing to an IPO, there
          is no need to issue a cheque. Please write the Bank account number and
          sign the IPO application form to authorize your bank to make payment
          in case of allotment. In case of non allotment the funds will remain
          in your bank account. As a business we don't give stock tips, and have
          not authorized anyone to trade on behalf of others. If you find anyone
          claiming to be part of Zerodha and offering such services, please
          create a ticket here.
